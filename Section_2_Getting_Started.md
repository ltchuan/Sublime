## 2.3 Multiple Cursors and Incremental Search

Use `Ctrl + D` to select the current word (word that text cursor is currently on), repeat to select the next occurrence of that word as well. This will automatically create multiple cursors at the end of each selection so that you can quickly change a bunch if words. `Alt + F3` will select every occurrence of the current word and make cursors at the end of each.

Column selection uses `Shift + RMB` or `MMB`. `Ctrl` to add to selection and `Alt` to subtract.

`Shift + Ctrl + L` to add a cursor to the end of each line selected (so will yield multiple cursors if multiple lines are selected). Cursor is actually added to the end of the selection, so if the last line is only partially selected, the cursor won't be at the end of that line but at the end of the selection.

Instant search using `Ctrl + I` then press enter to go to that location.
